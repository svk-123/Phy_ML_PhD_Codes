## Physics-Based AI Models and Simulations

This repository contains a collection of codes developed during my PhD research, focusing on applying machine learning to physics-based simulations and models. Using frameworks like TensorFlow, Python, and OpenFOAM, these codes aim to aid and enhance Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations through existing data.

Note: This collection is currently somewhat unorganized, as it includes various scripts and models in their original research state. I plan to clean and refactor the code soon, providing detailed tutorials and documentation to help users reproduce the results, along with relevant datasets.
